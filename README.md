# JsDelivr CDN Link Generator

 a simple web tool that helps you generate CDN links for files hosted on GitHub or GitHub Raw.

## Overview

CDN (Content Delivery Network) links are useful for loading resources such as JavaScript, CSS, and images faster by distributing them across multiple servers worldwide. MyCDN Link Generator automates the process of generating CDN links for your GitHub-hosted files, making it easier for you to integrate them into your projects.

## Features

- Generate CDN links for files hosted on GitHub or GitHub Raw.
- Support for multiple input URLs, separated by newlines or whitespaces.
- One-click copy functionality to quickly copy generated CDN links.
- Intuitive and user-friendly interface.

## Usage

1. **Input URLs**: Paste the URL(s) of your file(s) hosted on GitHub or GitHub Raw into the input field. You can input multiple URLs, separated by newlines or whitespaces.

2. **Generate Links**: The CDN links corresponding to the input URLs will be automatically generated and displayed in the output field.

3. **Copy Links**: Click the "Copy URL" button next to each generated CDN link to copy it to the clipboard.

## Example

Suppose you have the following URLs:
- https://github.com/exampleUser/exampleRepo/blob/main/script.js
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exampleUser/exampleRepo/main/style.css

MyCDN Link Generator will produce the following CDN links:
- https://cdn.example.com/user/repo/script.js
